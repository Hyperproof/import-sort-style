# import-sort-style-hyperproof

import-sort style forked from https://github.com/ruszki/import-sort-style-ruszki and slightly modified to sort module members alphabetically rather than alphabetically upper case first then lower case

Usage:

project must have `prettier-plugin-import-sort` installed in order for this to work. Prettier will automatically pick this plugin up based on the configuration in the parent package.json.
